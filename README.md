# EVMP Analysis

## Introduction 

This repository contains code for analyzing data from the Elk and Vegetation Monitoring Program collected from 2006-2018. 

The final product of the project will be an NPS Natural Resources Report detailing: 

1. Statistical methods used to analyze data  
2. Changes to sampling protocols, site locations, or major events affecting monitoring sites over the study period  
3. Observed results and interpretation of these results in the context of the objectives of the EVMP. 

In addition to annotated R code for all statistical analyses, CSU will provide training so that the analyses can be repeated by NPS managers and repeated using data collected in the future. A presentation of the results of the analysis will be made to park managers in late 2019 or early 2020. 

CSU will also consult with park biologists and resource managers to assist with creating appropriate strategies to deal with 1) establishing willow sites in the Kawuneeche Valley and 2) dealing with increased herbivory on the elk winter range resulting from range expansion by moose. 

### Products

1.	National Park Service Natural Resources Report detailing the analyses conducted and presentation and interpretation of results. 
2.	R code duplicating past analyses originally run in SAS (Zeigenfuss and Johnson 2015). R code and supporting documentation will be provided to RMNP and will enable a skilled analyst to reproduce analyses and apply all steps of data analysis to new data. 

### Project Timeline

FY18
Summer/Fall 2018 — Consultation between CSU scientistists and Hanem Abouelezz (RMNP) regarding recommended analyses. Conversion of statistical code from SAS software to R.

FY19
By end of October 2018 — Rocky Mountain National Park provides clean electronic copy of structure/composition data from willow and aspen sites and line transect data from upland sites, as well as site photos.

November 2018 through April 2019 — Analysis of 10 years of vegetation monitoring data, including analysis of monitoring sites burned in 2012 Fern Lake Fire.

April 2019 through June 2019 — Delivery of draft report, preparation of publication, and work session with park biologists to understand use of analytical codes.

FY20
October 2019 or later — Presentation of data results by CSU scientists to RMNP staff.

March 31, 2020 — Publication of final report.
