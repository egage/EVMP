## Introduction

This document provides a basic exploration of EVMP files provided by RMNP in September, 2018.

Analyses aim to characterize basic data structure and identify potential issues such as:

* Inconsistently named/typed factors    
* Missing values
* Data values outside of expected range or showing unusual patterns

In addition, data are cleaned in preparation for further analyses.

# Data Importation, Exploration, and Wrangling




# Translation of Past Analyses from SAS 

## Willow Height

Rewrite the SAS program used to analyze willow height data as found in table 9 of Zeigenfuss and Johnson (2015)--Least squares means of average and maximum willow height and percent willow cover on burned sites compared to unburned sites using the macroplot method at EVMP willow monitoring sites in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. 

**Steps:** 

1. Read in data from a file contaning the baseline data from willow macroplots  
2. Calculate canopy area for each plot and assigns the baseline year (2008) to these data 
3. Sort data down to willow and non-willow species groups and calculates mean for the variables "average height" and "maximum ht" for each group.

## Aspen Height  

Rewrite the SAS program used to create figs. 3,4,5, and 7 of Zeigenfuss and Johnson (2015)--Distribution of aspen tree (height greater than 2.5 meters) stem diameters in monitoring sites. 

**Steps:** 
1. Read in data from a file with tallies of live aspen stems by dbh size class  
2. Read in a file with information for each aspen monitoring site  
3. Merge these two files, remove saplings 
4. Reclass trees into groups of small (2-10 cm dbh), medium (10-20 cm dbh) and large (20+ dbh) trees.
